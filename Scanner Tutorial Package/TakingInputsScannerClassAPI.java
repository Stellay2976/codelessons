/* The Scanner class has a lot of methods. Don't memorize them. They
will always be provided. Don't try to memorize any methods, focus
on learning how to read the documentation and find what is needed.*/

 // There are a couple core methods that you will naturally memorize.

 /* It is important that you appreciate how to read the documentation
and find the methods you need.*/

/* The three methods that we will use:
     1. String ------------------> next() [Finds and returns the next complete token from this scanner]
     2. double -----------------> nextDouble() [Scans the next token of the input as a double]
     3. int --------------------> nextInt() [Scans the next token of the input as an int]
